    <p class="centertext">
      I am a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) pursuing a bachelor's degree in
      Computer Science (CS) with a minor in Robotic Engineering (RBE). WPI has a strong
      project-based curriculum, meaning, I have a lot of experince working with teams of all
      sizes and on some pretty intersting projects. I am always trying to
      develop and improve myself either by reading books, listing to podcasts or simplying learing
      from my mistakes. I absolutly love computer science because I think it is such an improwering
      tool. There are so many problems in the world and I really believe that CS is the right
      tool to solve many of these problems.
